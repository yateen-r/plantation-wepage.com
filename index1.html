            <p>Plantation refers to the process of planting trees, shrubs, or other vegetation in an area to create a
                forest or improve the environment. It often involves large-scale reforestation and afforestation efforts
                to restore degraded lands, improve air quality, and enhance biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Importance of Plantation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> Plantations help in reducing carbon dioxide levels,
                    improving air quality, and mitigating climate change. They also contribute to soil conservation and
                    water regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Planting a diverse range of species can enhance biodiversity,
                    providing habitat for wildlife and preserving various plant species.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Plantations can provide timber, fruits, nuts, and other
                    products, contributing to the economy and providing employment opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Benefits:</strong> Green spaces created by plantations can improve the quality of
                    life, offering recreational areas and enhancing the beauty of the landscape.</li>
